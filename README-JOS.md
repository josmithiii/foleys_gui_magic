This is the merge branch, which merges main with all proposed feature branches so I have something to really use now.

BRANCH  		STORY
------                  -----
merge 			- this branch
main  			- original main branch, tracking origin
pole-zero 		- XYDragComponent with circles and crosses
scatter-plot-for-main   - ALL JOS plot stuff for PGM (must finish)
scatter-plot	        - Potentially just the scatter-plot, if I can wean it to
                          use MagicPlotComponent instead of MagicAudioPlotComponent
                          (considering this if finishing scatter-plot-for-main is just too much)
midi-display            - Simple GuiItem for displaying latest MIDI (like what Logic displays)
