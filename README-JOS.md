This is the merge branch, which merges main with all proposed feature branches.
IT ALSO CONTAINS EXPERIMENTAL NEW CHANGES. See README-MERGE.md for more about that.

BRANCH  		STORY
------                  -----
merge 			- this branch (merge of all below plus new experiments)
main  			- original main branch, tracking origin - should always match Daniel's
pole-zero 		- XYDragComponent with circles and crosses
scatter-plot-for-main   - ALL JOS plot stuff for PGM (much to finish)
scatter-plot	        - Potentially just the scatter-plot, if I can wean it to
                          use MagicPlotComponent instead of MagicAudioPlotComponent
                          (considering this if finishing scatter-plot-for-main is too much work)
midi-display            - Simple GuiItem for displaying latest MIDI (like what Logic displays)
